comment frontend done in major.ejs and minorDetail.ejs
now manage backend, i.e. comment type inminor model,

make img compulsory for both user and author

to check author or user, add typ key in comment 
format date to be shown 
if typ: author, then show star with comment name

apply same for minor

reinitialise all minor, major, authorinfo

bcoz wrong comments hatane hain aur har user ki img chahie compulsory
